### IRM petit animal
IRM 4.7 T (BioSpec 47/40 USR, Bruker)

### x-ray microCT scanner
microCT VivaCT40-SCANCO (Voltage : 70 kVp, current: 112 µA, Integration time: 200 ms, resolution : 76 µm, binning: 4, 125 proj/180°). 

### x-ray portal camera of the SARRP 
see publication "Development and implementation of EPID-based quality assurance tests for the small animal radiation research platform (SARRP)", Akbar Anvari, Yannick Poirier, and Amit Sawant
_The SARRP system uses a single x-ray source with a focal spots at 0.4 mm for imaging. Imaging is performed with a 1-mm Al filter and a tube kV peak (kVp) ranging from 50 to 120. The x-ray source is mounted on a rotating gantry, with a nominal source-to-isocenter distance of 35 cm. 
The in-built EPID is mounted directly on the SARRP gantry as shown in Figure 1. The detector consists of a 0.08-mm carbon fiber on top and an x-ray-to-visible light scintillation screen (DRZ-Plus; MCI Optonix, Sedona, AZ) coupled to a 16-bit CCD camera (Flea2G 1.3 MP; FLIR Systems, Wilsonville, OR; 1280 × 960 pixels) via a 45° tilted mirror + lens (Sony ICX445; Sony Corp, Tokyo, Japan), as shown in Figure 2._
